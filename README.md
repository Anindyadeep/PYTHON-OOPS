## Python OOP
OOPs is a very important concepts in python. Unlike general scripting, with the help of OOP we can write more realistic code by strcuturing and 
making the data more secured and more organised. SO today I have learned OOPs in python and its four most very important properties like:

1. Inheritance
2. Polymorphism
3. Abstractions
4. Encapsulation

First of all a huge thanks to @Patrick Loeber (Python Engineer) for the great video tutorial
[The link to the awesome tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pEs-Bss8Wc&list=PLqnslRFeH2UrZtzqlXDWHjI3OV3BK0UWI&index=1)
At the same time I added some more fun in the .ipynb files to it for getting more fun to get the tutorial. 

The main Things which are covered here are as follows:

### PART 1
1.  Create a class (blueprint)
2.  Create an instance (object)
3.  Class vs Instance
4.  Instance attributes defined in init (self parameter)
5.  Class attributes (remaines constant for all the instances)

6.  How to create an instance method
7.  How to create a class method
8.  How to create some special functions like str, eq and their importance
9.  Why and where self is used
10. difference between class and instance method
11. How to create a static function (using ```@decorator```) with the help of a decorator that will be applicable for both class and instance method
12. Importance of decorator in the static method

### PART 2
13. Inheritance
14. How to use child class
15. Inherit the attributes and functions
16. Extend the attributes and functions
17. Override the attributes and function
18. Using the method ```super().init```
19. Polymorphism (doubt)

### PART 3
20. Encapsulation
21. Abstraction of functions with the help of protected/private functions
22. Using getters and setters using decorators i.e. using ```@property``` and ```@<getter_function name>.setter``` method
